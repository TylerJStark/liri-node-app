LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Running the following commands in your terminal will do the following:

node liri.js concert-this 'concert or band name'
This will show the following information about each event to your terminal/bash window:

Name of the Venue

node liri spotify-this-song 'song name'
This will show the following about the song in your terminal/bash window:

liri do-what-it-says
The program will take the text inside of random.txt and use it to call the first command with the second part as it's parameter

Currently in random.txt, the following text is there:

spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way"
This would call the spotify-this-song function and pass in "I Want it That Way" as the song.
